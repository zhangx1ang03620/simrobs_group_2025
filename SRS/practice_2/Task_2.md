1. Look in the [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cV1CvAwOWxDQwrhasFfoV0_T6r5pmklhSiCanFWS2I4/edit?usp=sharing) and find yourself:

3. Compose the ODE from the mass spring damper system using variants below:

Use method described in ```SRS/lecture_1/lecture_1.pdf```.
4. #Try to solve analytically the ODE you composed. If you can't solve it, describe the reason and why?
  

6. From the list take coefficients of your ODE and solve them with three integrators: Explicit/Implicit Euler, Rung-Kutta methods.
7. Compare results of these methods with analytical solution, dicsuss and conclude your thoughts in the .pdf report.
8. Name of the report should be "ISU_YourName_task1.pdf"
